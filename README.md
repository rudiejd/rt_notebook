# rt_notebook

Marimo notebook for looking at MBTA GTFS RT feeds via LAMP catalog

## Setup

### Prerequisites:
- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) (optional)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)


First, get `uv`. If you're using `mise` you should be able to just run `mise install`. Then run `uv run marimo edit notebook.py`. `uv` should take care of installing the dependencies

For accessing LAMP, you will need AWS credentials set up locally.
